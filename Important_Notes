1)LRU CACHE 

        The lru_cache decorator from Python's functools module is a very useful feature for optimizing performance, particularly in recursive functions like the one in your code. "LRU" stands for "Least Recently Used." Here's what lru_cache does:

        Caching: lru_cache stores the results of function calls, using the function's arguments as the key. If the function is later called with the same arguments, it doesn't compute the result again but instead retrieves it from the cache. This is especially beneficial in recursive functions where the same function with the same parameters is called multiple times.

        Efficiency: Without caching, recursive functions can become inefficient for large inputs as they repeatedly calculate the same values. By caching results, lru_cache drastically reduces the number of computations, leading to significant performance improvements.

        LRU Strategy: The "Least Recently Used" part means that the cache has a fixed size (you can set this size; the default is 128). If the cache exceeds this size, the least recently used items are discarded to make room for new ones. This strategy is effective in managing memory usage, especially in scenarios where some values are accessed more frequently.

        Decorator Syntax: @lru_cache(None) or @lru_cache(maxsize=None) means that the cache has no limit on its size. All results are stored unless explicitly cleared. In your code, @lru_cache(None) is used, ensuring that every unique call to rec across all recursive calls is cached, which is very helpful in dynamic programming scenarios.

.REVERSE() AND REVERSED()
.reverse() and reversed() are both used to reverse the order of elements in a sequence (like a list or string) in Python. However, they have some differences:

.reverse(): This is a method that directly modifies the list it is called on. It does not return a new list, instead it reverses the elements of the original list in-place. Therefore, it doesn't work with immutable sequences like strings or tuples. If you try to use .reverse() on an immutable sequence, you'll get an AttributeError because these types do not have a .reverse() method.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)  # Output: [3, 2, 1]

my_string = "Hello"
my_string.reverse()  # Raises AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'reverse'

reversed(): This is a built-in Python function that works with any iterable, not just lists. It returns a reverse iterator, which you can convert to a list or tuple if needed. It does not modify the original sequence.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = list(reversed(my_list))
print(new_list)  # Output: [3, 2, 1]

my_string = "Hello"
new_string = "".join(reversed(my_string))
print(new_string)  # Output: "olleH"
Remember, reversed() won't work with non-iterable objects. If you try to use reversed() on a non-iterable, you'll get a TypeError stating that the object is not reversible.


function  count :
However, it's important to note that the count() 
'function in Python does not count overlapping substrings.
 In the example above, the two 'aaa' substrings it counts
  are non-overlapping ('aaa' and 'aaa'). If you want to 
  count overlapping substrings, you would need to implement a different approach,
   such as using a loop to iterate over the string and check for the substring at each position.

or if you want to count all the overlapping , for eg. if u want to know all occurences of repeated a substring with 
length greater than 3, we can do count(aaa) + count(aaaa) + count (aaaaa) 

cuz if u need count(aaa aaa) i.e 6 a's then 6 a's is 3a +3a , 7a's is 3a + 4a ;8 a's is 4a+4a and so on.
