*matrix means matrix is transposed but we cannot access it directly 
if i want to go thru columns i do 
for row in matrix:
    row[0]=..  ill go thru all elements in first column

for i in matrix[0]:
    for row in matrix:
        print(row[i])

ill got thru column wise each column at a time

matrix=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
columns = list(zip(*matrix))
above line gives output as list of tuples where each tuple is a column
print(columns) #[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]
